serial_upload.py - upload a sketch to a dsPIC33CK serial bootloader.

Standard library only. The serial port is opened through the Win32 API with
ctypes rather than pyserial, because the platform is Windows-only anyway and the
first-run experience should not depend on `pip install`. Nothing else here is
platform-specific: only the SerialPort class at the bottom of the I/O section.

Two things in this file have historically been got wrong in dsPIC host tools and
are therefore spelled out:

  * HEX ENCODING. A dsPIC Intel HEX record holds FOUR bytes per 24-bit
    instruction word - low, middle, high, and a fourth "phantom" byte that is
    always 0x00 - and the record address is TWICE the program-memory address.
    A tool that walks the record bytewise, as the deleted tools/upload_uart.py
    did, silently programs a quarter of the image as padding. Every phantom byte
    is asserted to be 0x00 here; if one is not, the assumption is wrong and the
    tool stops rather than guessing.

  * CRC-32 DEFINITION. The device checksums FLASH, not the HEX file, so the host
    has to build the identical byte stream: three bytes per instruction word,
    little-endian within the word, phantom byte excluded, and every gap inside
    the image span filled with 0xFFFFFF because that is what erased flash reads
    as. bl_crc.h carries the same paragraph on the firmware side.

Usage:
    serial_upload.py --port COM7 --hex sketch.hex
    serial_upload.py --hex sketch.hex --dry-run      (parse and check, no board)

Exit status is 0 only if the image was written, verified by the device's own
CRC-32, and committed.
