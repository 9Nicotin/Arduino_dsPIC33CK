 * itself in a loop with no way in but a debugger. So the last 0x700 addresses
 * of the program region are permanently unused. That is the price of erasing
 * the application with plain page erases and no special cases.
 */

/* --- flash geometry ------------------------------------------------------ */
/*
 * Erase step, deliberately conservative.
 *
 * The EDC description of this device says erasepagesize="1024" with
 * sizeunits="words", which reads either as 1024 instruction words (0x800
 * addresses) or as 1024 addresses (0x400, i.e. 512 instruction words) - and
 * Microchip's own field-proven code for this family disagrees with the wider
 * reading, using a 0x400 page. That cannot be settled from the files on this
 * machine, so the bootloader is built to be correct under BOTH readings:
 *
 *   - it ALIGNS and RESERVES with 0x800 (the larger), so no region boundary can
 *     ever land inside a page that is shared with something it must not erase;
 *   - it ERASES with a 0x400 step across the whole application region. If the
 *     page really is 0x800, each page is simply erased twice, which is harmless
 *     because every erase happens before any programming. If the page is 0x400
 *     and we stepped by 0x800, we would erase every OTHER page and then program
 *     into un-erased flash - the failure this choice exists to prevent.
 *
 * Microchip's EZBL bootloader library is set to a 0x400 erase step on both
 * dsPIC33CH and dsPIC33CK boards in shipped demos, which is the same
 * conservative choice: a 0x400 step is correct whichever the page turns out to
 * be, a 0x800 step is only correct if the page really is 0x800.
 *
 * Nothing else depends on the page size: programming uses double-word writes,
 * not row writes, so BL_WIRE_BLOCK_WORDS below is a wire chunk size and not a
 * hardware row.
